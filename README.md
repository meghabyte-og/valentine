# Be My Valentine? ðŸ’–

An interactive Valentine's Day-themed web application that presents users with a playful question and dynamic button behavior.

## Features
- Engaging user interface with an animated illustration.
- Two response options: "Yes" and "No."
- "Yes" button redirects to a confirmation page.
- "No" button moves away on hover, preventing selection.

## Functionality
1. The user is presented with a card asking, "Will you be my Valentine?"
2. Selecting "Yes" navigates to `yes.html`, confirming the response.
3. Attempting to select "No" triggers movement of the button, preventing interaction.

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/valentine-card.git
   cd valentine-card
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
